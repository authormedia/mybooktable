A WordPress Bookstore Plugin to help authors create powerful and effective book pages.

== Description ==

[vimeo http://vimeo.com/65924127]

Forget everything you think you know about selling your book online. We’re changing it. You won’t need SSL certificates, shopping carts, or piles of books in your basement. All you’ll need is an affiliate account and a website. Oh, and a book.

= Benefit #1: Easy to Use =
We’re building MyBookTable from the ground up to be easy to use, even for technophobes. We will also build in tutorial videos to walk you through every step. The PRO & DEVELOPER levels also come with support just in case you get stuck. We will be continually improving and refining the plugin throughout the year.

= Benefit #2: Search Optimized =
Most authors don’t rank for their own book titles on Google. Scary, right? That means someone else (coughAmazoncough) is cashing in on your hard work. MyBookTable will help you retake control. Ranking #1 on search engines for your book title is extra valuable when you have affiliate accounts set up (see benefit #3).

= Benefit #3: Affiliate Compatible (PRO & Developer only) =
Amazon, BN.com, and CBD.com all offer affiliate programs that can help you supplement your income as an author. You won’t have to sell your book out of the back of a van to make more money.  It will also integrate with leading SEO Plugins like Yoast and Scribe.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the mybooktable directory to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory of your site.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Refer to the plugin help pages if you need further assistance.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will I need to ship books if I use MyBookTable? =

No! The whole idea behind MyBookTable is that Amazon (and others) do all the hard work of taking credit cards and shipping for you. All you do is list your books and get your affiliate commission and royalties. The developer level does integrate with PayPal so that if you do want to ship your own books, you can. But we imagine most users won't use that feature.

= Do I need to be an author to use MyBookTable? =

No! This plugin would work great for anyone wanting to have an Amazon Affiliate Bookstore.
