A WordPress Bookstore Plugin to help authors boost book sales on sites like Amazon and Apple iBooks with great-looking book pages.

== Description ==

[vimeo http://vimeo.com/65924127]

Forget everything you think you know about selling your book online. We’re changing it. You won’t need SSL certificates, shopping carts, or piles of books in your basement. All you’ll need is a WordPress website. Oh, and a book.

MyBookTable allows you to have your own bookstore that links to online bookstores where visitors can buy the book.

You can find a **live demo** of MyBookTable in action [here](http://www.authormedia.com/books/ "MyBookTable Demo").

= FEATURES =

= Easy to Use (Improved in 2.0) =

= Drag and Drop Control  =
Easily control which books appear at the top of your book table page with a simple drag-and-drop interface.

= Make Your Individual Book Pages Look Amazing =
MyBookTable allows you to easily make great-looking book pages. Whether you want a list of books or a individual book page, MyBookTable gives you maximum control with minimum hassle.

= Social Media Integration =
MyBookTable makes it easy for visitors to like and share your books on social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and Google+. It also works with plugins like ShareThis.

Customize your store by showing some of the buy buttons as a bulleted list. Also, choose from multiple buy button color schemes.

= Buy Button Shadow Box (New in 2.0) =
Have a a lot of buy buttons cluttering up your book pages? No worries. MyBookTable 2.0 allows you to show a single "buy now" button that opens a shadow box with all your buy buttons.

= Featured Book Widget =
Feature a book on your sidebar with just a few clicks. You can even add multiple books by adding multiple widgets.

=  Mobile Responsive =
If your WordPress theme is mobile responsive, MyBookTable will react similarly, delivering maximum compatibility for visitors on phones and tablets.

= Recommend Books (New in 2.0) =
Do you want to sell books by other authors? MyBookTable now has a "Recommended Books" tag out of the box so you can sell not only your books but other authors' books as well.

= Advanced Search Engine Optimization =

* **A Search-Optimized Page for Each Book**
Having a search-optimized book page may seem small, but this option makes a huge difference in how many people find your book. Most authors cram all their books onto one page. With so many titles per page, no one book can rank or get coveted Google juice. MyBookTable allows you to create a page for each book, as well as a page with all books listed, so you get the best of both worlds. Edit one and it updates the other. This gives you a much better chance of ranking higher when someone searches for one of your titles.

* **Native SEO Controls**
If you don’t currently use an SEO plugin, MyBookTable provides meta titles and descriptions as if you did, complete with optimized defaults in case you don’t want to bother optimizing it yourself.

* **Advanced SEO Integration**
MyBookTable integrates with popular SEO plugins like WordPress SEO by Yoast and Scribe SEO. If you use one of these plugins, you get full access to their power.

* **Semantic Markup and OpenGraph**
MyBookTable has built-in semantic markup, giving you the edge on search engines like Google and social networks like Facebook. We do all the heavy lifting for you, so your pages are naturally searchable.  This should improve Search Engine Optimization and social optimization.

= GoodReads Integration & Book Reviews =
MyBookTable has deep integration with the world’s most popular social network for readers. MBT shows your GoodReads reviews, and it provides a button that allows users to add your book to their GoodReads BookShelf.

= Built-In Tutorial Videos =
MyBookTable has built-in tutorial videos showing you how to use the plugin for maximum effect.

= Compatibility Mode =
With thousands of Wordpress themes in existence, we can’t guarantee that MBT will work with every theme. So we have created a compatibility mode that allows for maximum compatibility with your theme. MyBookTable integrates with all the major theme frameworks, including Genesis, Woo Canvas, most Elegant Themes, and many Theme Forest Themes. Thesis is the only framework known not to work.

= Easy Shortcode Interface =
MBT adds an icon to the WordPress WYSIWYG Editor that allows you to add MyBookTable shortcodes to your site with just a couple of clicks.

= Built-in Breadcrumbs =
We have added breadcrumbs, which will not only make your book pages easier to use for your visitors, but will also improve search engine optimization. These breadcrumbs are fully compatible with the Genesis or Woo Canvas breadcrumb systems.

= GetNoticed! Theme Integration =
MyBookTable can import books from Michael Hyatt's GetNoticed! theme. MyBookTable and GetNoticed! now work together seamlessly.

= Book Widgets =
MyBookTable gives you several cool book widgets. Including a featured book widget, genre widget, series widget, and more!

= Premium Features (Available with Upgrade) =

= Universal Buy Button (Professional Upgrade Required) =
Create a button that points to any site on the web. You have full control over both the text and the link.

= Affiliate Compatible (Professional Upgrade Required) =
Amazon, BN.com, and CBD.com all offer affiliate programs that help you supplement your income as an author. You won’t have to sell your book out of your garage to make more money. It also integrates seamlessly with leading SEO Plugins like Yoast and Scribe.

Affiliate platforms supported:
* Amazon (Amazon, Kindle)
* Commission Junction (Audible)
* Linkshare (Barnes & Noble, Kobo)

= Grid View (Professional Upgrade Required) =
Show your books in a responsive grid view.  This is a great option for sites with a lot of books to show.

= Notify Me Button (Professional Upgrade Required) =
Allow visitors to sign up for book updates by subscribing to your MailChimp list. This button can act as a Pre-Pre-Order button for books that are still a work in process.

= Show Amazon Reviews (Professional Upgrade Required) =
Show off your Amazon reviews right there on your book pages.

= Amazon Bulk Book Importer (Developer Upgrade Required) =
Want to add 100 books? No problem. Just paste the ISBN numbers into MyBookTable and let the plugin create the book pages for you. This is a huge timesaver.

= UIEE Book Importer (Developer Upgrade Required) =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will I need to ship books if I use MyBookTable? =

No! The whole idea behind MyBookTable is that Amazon (and other online retailers) do all the hard work of taking credit card information and dealing with postage and shipping. All you do is list your books and get your affiliate commission and royalties. The developer level does integrate with PayPal so that if you do want to ship your own books, you can. But we imagine most users won't use that feature.

= Do I need to be an author to use MyBookTable? =

No! This plugin would work great for anyone wanting to have an Amazon Affiliate Bookstore.
