# Custom Admin Pages for WordPress

Does the Settings API drive you crazy? You're not the only one! This is a library for wordpress to help you quickly and easily create new admin pages of any type.
It is based HEAVILY on the Custom Metaboxes and Fields plugin, with some sections straight up copy-pasted from it, at least for now. Be warned, this is extremely WIP right now.
